## Advent of Code 2025

Solution to the 2025 edition of Advent of Code in Swift. The solutions will avoid code golf tricks, and try to be simple. They may not be the cleanest or the fastest - a correct answer is a correct answer after all - but the idea is to keep them fairly clean, and acceptably fast.

Liberties have been taken. The path to the puzzle input files is hard coded, so change **Utilities.resourceDirectory** before you try and use the code. I also play fast and lose with forced unwrapping of optionals and error handling, as I trust the input. 🙈
